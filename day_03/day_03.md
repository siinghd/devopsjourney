operator >  overwrites the file, what do I mean by that? if we want to add something else to the file3.txt it will overwrite hello i am newline.

hello i am newline2 -> overwrites the entire file.

operator >> with this operator we will append to the file, if we try to add something new to the file it will just append to the bottom.

hello i am newline

hello i am newline2 -> appended
