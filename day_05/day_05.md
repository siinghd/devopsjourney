Assignment 1:

What is the need of IAM?
IAM stands for identity access management, the need of IAM is to create new users, policies , group , roles and give the users right policies so they can access only specific resource to avoid price increase or misusing of an service.

If i am a non tech person, how will you define policies in IAM.
I would define policies as rules or guidelines that define's single users or groups have.Like in company manager have more permission the the normal employees. With polcies we just define that in the AWS environment.

Please define a scenerio in which you would like to createyour on own IAM policy.
I would like to create my own policy when there aren't any policy available that doesn't satisfy my need, like with expire condition.

Why do we prefer not using root account?
Because root user has every permission and can manage other users and every aws service.
With root user we can disable other user if has been hacked.

How to revoke policy for an IAM user?
We can remove the user from group it belongs and if the user has any policy attached we can also remove it.

Can a single IAM user be a part of multiple policy via group and root? how?
Yes, user can be in multiple groups and each group can have multiple policies. Also single user can have multiple policies attached.
